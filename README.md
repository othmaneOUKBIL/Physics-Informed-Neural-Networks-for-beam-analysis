 Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that

encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a

component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve

PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic

PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning frame-

work in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual.

This project investigates the application of PINNs to solve nonlinear beam

equations, which are fundamental in engineering for understanding beam

behavior under various constraints.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!

I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved with this project and am excited about the future possibilities. I look forward to engaging with the community and sharing insights from this journey. You can read the full report here: 1st year master thesis.

In this report, weâ€™ve explored how Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can solve partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing specifically on their application to beam static equations. By incorporating the laws of physics directly into their framework, PINNs offer a novel and efficient way to solve these complex equations without relying solely on traditional numerical methods. our exploration of PINNs highlights their significant potential in civil engineering. But the technology is not without limitations. PINNs still have some limitations. For forward problems, PINNs are currently slower than finite elements.

Thank you for reading, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
